# e-commerce-customer-churn-with-survival-analysis-

This project explores the use of survival analysis to identify and predict the customer churn rate of e-commerce users in the western market. The data contains multivariate information that further tests the capabilities of survival analysis which is typically used in other industries such as medical sector. 

On top of that, the use of LSTM neural network models to identify and forecast demand within a time frame of daily, weekly and monthly can be use for a better indication of the further demand and identify the demand of customers.
